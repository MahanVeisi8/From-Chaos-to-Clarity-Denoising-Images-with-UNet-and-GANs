# **Denoising Facial Emotion Dataset Using Attention U-Net and GAN**

## **Introduction**

Welcome to an exciting journey into the world of deep learning and image restoration! ðŸŽ‰ In this project, we dive into the challenge of denoising grayscale facial images, taking on various levels of noise that can obscure the rich emotional expressions captured in the data. Leveraging cutting-edge architectures like **Attention U-Net** and **GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)**, we aim to breathe life back into noisy images and showcase the power of modern neural networks. 

The dataset at the heart of this project is derived from the well-known **FER2013 dataset**, consisting of pixel-based grayscale images of facial expressions. Our goal? To strip away the noise and let the underlying emotions shine through.

Why does this matter? Noise in images can wreak havoc on tasks like emotion recognition and facial analysis. By addressing three distinct types of noiseâ€”**low Gaussian noise**, **high Gaussian noise**, and **salt-and-pepper noise**â€”we're not just restoring clarity but also paving the way for more accurate downstream applications. 

Here's what makes this project special:
- **Attention U-Net Magic**: A model that zooms in on the most relevant parts of noisy images, ensuring precision and high fidelity.  
- **PatchGAN Wizardry**: A patch-based GAN approach that brings a unique perspective to denoising, ensuring both local and global coherence.  
- **Thorough Evaluation**: With metrics like **PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)** and **SSIM (Structural Similarity Index Measure)**, alongside stunning visualizations, we provide a comprehensive assessment of our models' performance.  

By the end of this project, youâ€™ll see how these advanced models tackle complex noise scenarios and how you can use these insights for your own image restoration challenges. Letâ€™s bring these faces into focus! ðŸ˜Š

## **Data Preprocessing and Noise Augmentation**

Our dataset consists of compact, grayscale facial images, each sized at **48x48 pixels**â€”small but packed with emotional depth! To prepare these images for training, we focused on maintaining their integrity while ensuring uniformity. Each image represents a unique facial expression, making them a perfect candidate for our denoising tasks. ðŸŽ­

### **Preprocessing Steps**

Hereâ€™s how we got the data ready for action:  
1. **Loading and Preprocessing**: We extracted images from the **FER2013 dataset**, applying pixel intensity normalization to ensure consistency across the dataset.  
2. **Splitting the Dataset**: The data was divided into **training**, **validation**, and **test** sets, following predefined splits to ensure robust and reproducible results.  

### **Sample Images**

### **Adding a Little Chaos â€“ Noise Augmentation**

To really test our modelsâ€™ capabilities, we introduced **three distinct types of noise** to mimic real-world scenarios where images might be degraded. These augmentations help us evaluate the robustness of our denoising models under different conditions:  

1. **Low Gaussian Noise**: A mild blur effect with a standard deviation of 0.2 and noise factor of 0.2.  
2. **High Gaussian Noise**: A heavier distortion with a standard deviation of 0.4 and noise factor of 0.3.  
3. **Salt-and-Pepper Noise**: Speckled noise with a noise factor of 0.1, randomly introducing white ("salt") and black ("pepper") pixels.  

Hereâ€™s how the images look with each type of noise:  

#### **Gaussian Noise (Low)**

### **Models Overview**

Now for the stars of the show! This project features two advanced architectures designed for image restoration:  
1. **Attention U-Net**: Equipped with attention mechanisms to focus on the most important regions, making it a champion for precise denoising.  
2. **PatchGAN**: A GAN-based model that takes a patch-based approach, balancing local and global noise reduction.  

Letâ€™s dive into their design and how they tackle these noisy challenges head-on! ðŸš€

### **1. Attention U-Net**

The **Attention U-Net** builds upon the classic U-Net architecture by incorporating **attention mechanisms**, enabling the model to focus on relevant regions of the input dynamically. This enhancement ensures effective noise suppression while preserving essential structural and contextual features, making it highly suitable for image denoising tasks.

#### **Architecture**
The Attention U-Net is divided into four components:

```python
class AttentionUNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels=1, out_channels=1, use_attention=True, debug=False):
        super(AttentionUNet, self).__init__()
        self.debug = debug
        # Encoder
        self.enc1 = EncoderBlock(in_channels, 16)
        self.enc2 = EncoderBlock(16, 32)
        self.enc3 = EncoderBlock(32, 64)
        self.enc4 = EncoderBlock(64, 128)
        # Bottleneck
        self.bottleneck = ConvBlock(128, 256)
        # Decoder
        self.dec4 = DecoderBlock(256, 128, use_attention=use_attention, debug=debug)
        self.dec3 = DecoderBlock(128, 64, use_attention=use_attention, debug=debug)
        self.dec2 = DecoderBlock(64, 32, use_attention=use_attention, debug=debug)
        self.dec1 = DecoderBlock(32, 16, use_attention=False, debug=debug)
        # Final Output
        self.final_conv = nn.Conv2d(16, out_channels, kernel_size=1)
```

1. **Encoder**: 
   - Each `EncoderBlock` consists of convolutional layers for feature extraction and max-pooling for downsampling.
   - Optional **attention modules** refine features by focusing on spatially important regions based on the input context.

```python
class EncoderBlock(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels, use_attention=False, stride=2, padding=0, debug=False):
        super(EncoderBlock, self).__init__()
        self.conv = ConvBlock(in_channels, out_channels)
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=stride, padding=padding)
        if use_attention:
            self.attention = AttentionBlock(out_channels, out_channels, out_channels)
```

2. **Bottleneck**: 
   - A dense `ConvBlock` bridges the encoder and decoder, aggregating global context to capture high-level features.

3. **Decoder**:
   - Each `DecoderBlock` upsamples the feature maps using transposed convolutions, enabling reconstruction at higher resolutions.
   - Skip connections integrate fine-grained details from the encoder for precise restoration.
   - Attention mechanisms selectively refine the reconstructed features, helping prioritize meaningful information.

```python
class DecoderBlock(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels, use_attention=False, debug=False):
        super(DecoderBlock, self).__init__()
        self.upconv = nn.ConvTranspose2d(in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size=2, stride=2)
        self.conv = ConvBlock(out_channels * 2, out_channels)
        if use_attention:
            self.attention = AttentionBlock(out_channels, out_channels, out_channels)
```

4. **Output Layer**:
   - A single convolutional layer reduces the feature map to the target image dimensions, reconstructing the output to match the original image size (1 * 48 * 48).

---

#### **Training Highlights**
The Attention U-Net was trained using a carefully designed configuration:

- **Loss Function**: Mean Squared Error (MSE) ensures pixel-wise consistency between the denoised output and the clean ground truth. This choice balances simplicity and effectiveness for grayscale image restoration.
  
- **Optimization**:
  - **Optimizer**: Adam optimizer with an initial learning rate of `1e-3` ensures fast convergence.
  - **Scheduler**: A ReduceLROnPlateau scheduler dynamically lowers the learning rate when validation loss stagnates, preventing overfitting and improving generalization.

---

### **2. PatchGAN**

The **PatchGAN** framework combines the power of a generator (Attention U-Net) and a discriminator to refine the denoising process. The generator produces denoised outputs, while the discriminator evaluates their authenticity by focusing on both global structure and local detail. This dynamic adversarial training ensures that the denoised images are visually realistic and contextually accurate.

#### **Generator**
The **Attention U-Net**, discussed earlier, serves as the generator in this setup. Its attention mechanisms allow it to focus on noise-free regions of the input, ensuring high-quality reconstruction of the denoised output.

#### **Discriminator**
The discriminator, **PatchGANDiscriminator**, takes the denoised output from the generator and evaluates it against the ground truth (clean image). It does this by processing pairs of noisy-clean images or noisy-generated images and assessing their "realness" at a patch level.

```python
class PatchGANDiscriminator(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels=2, base_channels=32, stride=[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], padding=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], use_fc=False, global_pooling=False, debug=False):
        super(PatchGANDiscriminator, self).__init__()
        self.debug = debug
        self.use_fc = use_fc
        self.global_pooling = global_pooling
        # Encoder layers
        self.enc1 = EncoderBlock(in_channels, base_channels, use_attention=True, stride=stride[0], padding=padding[0], debug=debug)
        self.enc2 = EncoderBlock(base_channels, base_channels * 2, use_attention=False, stride=stride[1], padding=padding[1], debug=debug)
        self.enc3 = EncoderBlock(base_channels * 2, base_channels * 4, use_attention=True, stride=stride[2], padding=padding[2], debug=debug)
        # Final convolution
        self.final_conv = nn.Conv2d(base_channels * 2, 1, kernel_size=2, stride=stride[5], padding=padding[5])
        # Fully connected layers
        if self.use_fc:
            self.fc_dim = 12 * 12
            self.fc = nn.Sequential(
                # nn.Linear(base_channels * 8 * (22 * 22), self.fc_dim),
                nn.Linear(base_channels * 2, self.fc_dim),
                nn.Tanh(),  # Activation function
                nn.Linear(self.fc_dim, self.fc_dim),
                nn.Tanh()
            )

    def forward(self, x, y):
        combined = torch.cat([x, y], dim=1) 
        # Encoder forward pass
        features, downsampled = self.enc1(combined)
        features, downsampled = self.enc2(downsampled)
        features, downsampled = self.enc3(downsampled)
        out = self.final_conv(features)  # Shape: (B, 1, H', W')
        if self.use_fc:
            batch_size, channels, height, width = features.shape
            if self.global_pooling:
                pooled_features = torch.mean(features, dim=[2, 3]) 
                flattened = pooled_features.view(batch_size, -1)
            else:
                flattened = features.view(batch_size, -1) 
            fc_out = self.fc(flattened)  
            out = fc_out.view(batch_size, 1, height, width)
        return out

```

The discriminator operates on **two inputs**, concatenated channel-wise:  
1. A noisy image (real or generated).  
2. A clean image (ground truth or generated).  

By processing these inputs through its encoder layers, the discriminator outputs a matrix of **patch-based predictions**, where each score corresponds to the "realness" of a patch in the image.

To stabilize training, **label smoothing** is applied:  
- Real patches are labeled as **0.9**, preventing the discriminator from becoming overly confident.  
- Fake patches are labeled as **0.1**, encouraging the generator to refine its outputs.

---

The training process involves a careful balance between the generator and discriminator. The **generator loss** combines two objectives:  
1. **Reconstruction loss (L2)**: Ensures pixel-level accuracy by minimizing the difference between the denoised output and the clean image.  
2. **Adversarial loss**: Encourages the generator to produce images that the discriminator classifies as "real".  

The **discriminator loss** evaluates how effectively the discriminator distinguishes between real and fake patches. It combines the binary cross-entropy losses for real and fake predictions.

```python
gen_loss = l2_loss + 0.001 * adversarial_loss
disc_loss = (real_loss + fake_loss) / 2
```

Training is optimized using Adam for both generator and discriminator, with a learning rate of `1e-3`. A **ReduceLROnPlateau** scheduler is used to dynamically adjust the learning rate when validation loss plateaus, ensuring better generalization.  

This combination of patch-based evaluation, adversarial loss, and careful optimization results in a robust denoising process, capable of producing visually coherent and contextually accurate outputs.

## **Experimenting with Noise Reduction: Three Tasks**

After training the models, it's time to put them to the test! We evaluated the **Attention U-Net** and **PatchGAN** on the noisy test set across **three distinct tasks**, each addressing a specific type of noise. These tasks simulate real-world noise scenarios, challenging the models to restore clarity and preserve structural details.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the tasks:
1. **Task 1**: Denoising images corrupted with **Low Gaussian Noise**â€”a mild yet noticeable distortion.  
2. **Task 2**: Tackling **High Gaussian Noise**â€”a more aggressive form of degradation.  
3. **Task 3**: Managing **Salt-and-Pepper Noise**â€”a speckled, impulsive noise pattern.

### Task 1: Denoising Low Gaussian Noise

In this task, we focus on denoising grayscale images with **low Gaussian noise**, which mimics mild real-world distortions. Both the **Attention U-Net** and **PatchGAN** models were trained and evaluated for this purpose. Below, we present the denoised results and analyze the performance of the models.

![T1_GAN_Denoised](assets/task1/GAN_sample.png) 

---

#### **Performance Metrics**

The evaluation was conducted on the **test set**, and the results for both models are summarized below:

| Model         | Loss   | PSNR    | SSIM    | Explanation                                                                                                                                          |
|---------------|--------|---------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

---
## Task 2: Denoising High Gaussian Noise

In the second task, we tackled the challenge of denoising grayscale images corrupted with **high Gaussian noise**, which mimics severe real-world distortions. This task pushed the limits of both **Attention U-Net** and **PatchGAN**, evaluating their robustness in reconstructing heavily degraded images.

### **Performance Metrics**

The comparative results on the **test set** are summarized below:

| Model           | Loss   | PSNR    | SSIM    | Explanation                                                                                                                                                   |
|------------------|--------|---------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attention U-Net | 0.0161 | 23.9465 | 0.8720  | The U-Net demonstrates its robustness in handling high noise levels, though the complexity of this task led to a drop in metrics compared to Task 1.          |
| PatchGAN        | 0.0270 | 15.6816 | 0.7745  | PatchGAN struggled to capture finer details under severe noise. A simpler GAN architecture might achieve better results by focusing more on structural accuracy. |

---

### **Key Takeaways**
The results highlight that while **Attention U-Net** outshines **PatchGAN**, the increased noise severity remains a significant challenge for both models. These findings pave the way for future innovations, such as refining GAN architectures or introducing advanced loss functions tailored to handle intense noise scenarios.

---

## Task 3: Denoising Salt-and-Pepper Noise

For our final task, we explored the ability of **Attention U-Net** to tackle **salt-and-pepper noise**, a common form of impulse noise characterized by random "salt" (white) and "pepper" (black) pixels. While traditional techniques like median filtering are effective, we evaluated the performance of a deep learning approach on this challenge.

|------------------|--------|---------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attention U-Net | 0.0037 | 30.3950 | 0.9774  | The model achieved impressive results, demonstrating its ability to handle impulse noise with fidelity comparable to classical median filtering techniques.     |

---

### **Insights and Future Directions**

Salt-and-pepper noise is traditionally managed using simple filtering techniques like the **median filter**, which is computationally efficient and effective:
![T3_Median_Filter](assets/task3/median.jpg)

However, the **Attention U-Net** showed that deep learning models can match or even exceed classical methods, especially when integrated into larger pipelines. On the other hand, the **GAN model** struggled with this task, underscoring the need for specialized architectures or pre-processing steps for sparse, abrupt noise patterns. Future work could focus on:
- Designing **hybrid approaches** combining deep learning with classical filtering for optimal performance.
- Exploring **custom GAN architectures** tailored for impulse noise scenarios.
- Investigating **domain adaptation techniques** for models trained on one noise type to generalize better to other noise types.

This opens exciting opportunities for building robust models capable of handling diverse and challenging real-world noise conditions.
